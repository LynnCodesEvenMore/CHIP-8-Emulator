# CHIP-8-Emulator/Interpreter
Welcome to my 1st project: a CHIP-8 Emulator using only the FREEGLUT library!
(Technically this is an interpreter because CHIP-8 code was translated on-the-fly into cpu machine code back in the 70's on computers like the Cosmac Vip.
An emulator mimics a physical machine/computer, while CHIP-8 code is an invented programming language for an invented theoretical machine.
However it deserves the name emulator because it includes so much more: not only a pure interpreter but also graphics, I/O, etc.)

Why this project?
1.) I have a passion for emulators ever since I was little, for example playing on old gaming consoles or modifying my Nintendo DS with the help of friends to run a NES emulator.
2.) Everyone should write an emulator because it teaches you how a computer works: CPU cycles, keyboard input, graphics output, ...
3.) Show off! Play a game on your emulator and show it to people! Makes you feel proud! :)
4.) Use it in a motivation letter if you need to write one!
